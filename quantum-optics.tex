\chapter{Noise in optical measurement}
This chapter introduces various detection methods of light and explains noise appearing in each method. Some explanations are phenomenological but they will be explained by quantum optics in later chapters.

\section{Optical measurement}
Figure \ref{fig:photodetection}(a) shows the \textbf{direct detection}. Photodetectors can convert photons to electrons to measure optical power, which is proportional to the number of photons per unit time. 

Fig. \ref{fig:photodetection}(b) shows the \textbf{interferometric detection}, where a beamsplitter (BS) is used to mix the signal light wave to be measured and another light wave called local oscillator (LO) light, and the output light waves of the BS are detected with photodetectors to measure the amplitude of light. When the optical frequencies of signal and LO are the same, the method is called \textbf{homodyne}. When they are different, the method is called \textbf{heterodyne}.

Furthermore, an optical amplifier is often used before photodetection as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:photodetection}(c). This is called \textbf{preamplification}. Although not shown in the figure, it is also possible to conduct interferometric detection after preamplification. 

In any case, the output signal of the photodetector contains noise due to various origins such as instability of light sources or optical systems, circuit noise of photodetector(s), and so on. We can somehow reduce these noises, but at last we will see `quantum noise' that cannot be reduced by classical manner. Only quantum optics can control the quantum noise.

Here, before introducing various noise sources, we introduce direct detection, interferometric detection, and preamplification.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Direct detection}
In direct detection, a light wave is directly injected to a photodetector to measure the photocurrent $I$, which is proportional to the optical power $P$ as follows:
\begin{equation}
	I = \frac{\eta q P}{\hbar \omega},
	\nonumber
\end{equation}
where $\hbar \omega$ is the photon energy, and $q = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \ \mathrm{C}$ is the elementary charge. $P / \hbar \omega$ is the number of photons incident on the photodetector per unit time. $\eta$ is the quantum efficiency, which is the ratio of the number of photoelectrons and the number of photons.
\footnote{For electrical engineers, it is worth remembering that the photon energy at the optical communication wavelength 1.55 \ \textmu m is approximately 0.8 eV. Since $\hbar \omega / e$ is the photon energy in the unit of eV and typical photodiodes have a quantum efficiency of 90\%, typical conversion efficiency is $I/P \sim 1.1 \mathrm{A/W}$ (see catalogues of InGaAs photodiodes).}

\subsection{Homodyne and heterodyne detection}

Figure \ref{fig:photodetection}(b) shows a schematic of \textbf{balanced detector}, which is often used for homodyne and heterodyne. The light to be measured (signal) is combined with a local oscillator (LO) light by a beamsplitter (BS). Then, two light waves output from the BS are injected to photodetectors, and the difference of their photocurrents is taken. Denoting the optical frequencies of LO and signal light as $\omega$ and $\omega + \Delta \omega$, this method is called homodyne when $\Delta \omega = 0$ and heterodyne when $\Delta \omega \neq 0$.\footnote{These terms originate from frequency mixing in electrical circuits.}

The output signal of the balanced detector can be formulated as follows. We denote the complex amplitudes of signal and LO as $\alpha$ and $\beta$ such that $|\alpha|^2$ and $|\beta|^2$ corresponds to the number of photons in the time duration of $\tau$.\footnote{That is, the optical power of signal light is $|\alpha|^2\hbar \omega/\tau$.} We assume that $\Delta \omega \ll \omega$ such that the photon energy difference between signal and LO is negligible.\footnote{Without this assumption, the linear combination of the electric field between signal and LO requires quantum mechanical treatment.} Then the analytic signals of signal light and LO light are given by
\footnote{When a complex sinusoidal wave $S(t)=\mathrm{Re} \ S_0 e^{-i\omega t}$ is given, $S_0$ is called complex amplitude, while $S_0 e^{-i\omega t}$ is called analytic signal, which is composed only of positive frequency components. By taking the real part of the analytic signal, we can obtain a real signal.}
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
	a(t) &= \alpha e^{-i(\omega + \Delta \omega)t},\\
  	b(t) &= \beta e^{-i\omega t}.
\end{aligned}\label{eq:complex_amplitude}
\end{equation}
We assume that signal light and LO light are injected to the port 1 and the port 2 of BS, and that the coupling ratio of BS is 50\%. The output light waves at the port 3 and the port 4 are given by
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
  a' &= \frac{1}{\sqrt 2}(a - b),\\
  b' &= \frac{1}{\sqrt 2}(a + b),
\end{aligned}\label{eq:BS_complex_amplitude}
\end{equation}
respectively,\footnote{In the right hand side of the first equation in Eq. (\ref{eq:BS_complex_amplitude}), the sign of $b$ is minus. This corresponds to the assumption of fixed end reflection from port 2 to port 4. The definition can be different: What's important is that Eq. (\ref{eq:BS_complex_amplitude}) is a unitary transformation, which corresponding to the assumption that BS has no optical loss.}
or equivalently,
\begin{equation}
  \left( \begin{array}{c}
  	a' \\ b'
  \end{array}
  \right) =
  \frac{1}{\sqrt 2}\left( \begin{array}{r r} 
  	1 & -1 \\ 1 & 1
 \end{array}
	\right)
	\left( \begin{array}{c}
		a \\ b
	\end{array} \right).
	\label{eq:beamsplitter_matrix}
\end{equation}
The photocurrents $I_1$, $I_2$ of the two photodiodes are respectively given by
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
  I_1 &= \frac q \tau |a'|^2 = \frac{q}{\tau}\left|\frac{1}{\sqrt 2} (a - b)\right|^2,\\
  I_2 &= \frac q \tau |b'|^2 = \frac{q}{\tau}\left|\frac{1}{\sqrt 2} (a + b)\right|^2.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
The output of the balanced detector is
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
  I_2 - I_1 &= \frac{q}{\tau}(ab^* + a^* b) = \frac{2q}{\tau}\mathrm{Re}[ab^*] 
  = 4qB\mathrm{Re}[\alpha \beta^* e^{-i\Delta\omega t}]\\
  &= 4qB|\beta|\left\{\mathrm{Re} \left[  \alpha e^{-i\phi}\right] \cos \Delta \omega t  + \mathrm{Im} \left[ \alpha e^{-i\phi}\right] \sin \Delta \omega t\right\},
\end{aligned}\label{eq:output_of_balanced_detector}
\end{equation}
where $B = 1/2\tau$ is the Nyquist frequency, and $\beta = |\beta|e^{i\phi}$.
Equation \ref{eq:output_of_balanced_detector} shows the following points: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item When $\Delta \omega = 0$ (i.e., homodyne), $I_2 - I_1 = 4qB|\beta| \mathrm{Re} \ (\alpha e^{-i\phi})$. Therefore, homodyne gives the projection of $\alpha$ onto the axis at a phase of $\beta$. 
	\item When $\Delta \omega \neq 0$ (i.e., heterodyne), the output signal is a sinusoidal wave at $\Delta \omega$, whose complex amplitude is proportional to $\alpha$.
\end{itemize}



\section{Noise sources}
In this section, we summarize various noise sources such as shot noise \index{shot noise}, thermal noise \index{thermal noise}, and amplifier noise \index{amplifier noise}. You will see that by avoiding the effect of thermal noise, the signal-to-noise ratio becomes on the order of the number of photons. 

\subsection{Shot noise}
Shot noise refers to the noise due to the fluctuation in the number of photons. We assume that photons arrive in a stochastic and independent manner. The probability distribution $\mathrm{Pr}(X = k)$ of the number of photons $X$ obeys the Poisson distribution given by
\begin{equation}
	\mathrm{Pr}(X=k) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!},
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ is the average value. We can easily show that 
\begin{equation}
	\sum_{k=0}^\infty \mathrm{Pr}(X=k) = 1,
\end{equation}
and the expectation value and the variance are given by
\begin{equation}
	E[X] = \sum_{k=0}^\infty kp(k) = \lambda,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  	V[X] = \sum_{k=0}^\infty (k-\lambda)^2p(k) = \lambda,
\end{equation}
and therefore the standard deviation of the number of photons is $\sqrt \lambda$. Consequently, the root-mean-square (RMS) noise due to the fluctuation of the number of photons is given by
\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		I_{\mathrm{shot}} = q\sqrt{\lambda}/\tau = q\sqrt{\frac{I\tau}{q}}/\tau = \sqrt{\frac{qI}{\tau}},
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
or equivalently,
\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		I_\mathrm{shot}=\sqrt{2qIB}.
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
By defining the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as the energy ratio between signal and noise, we obtain the shot-noise-limited SNR as
\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{SNR} = I^2 / I_\mathrm{shot}^2 = I/2qB = 2qB|\alpha |^2/2qB = |\alpha|^2,
\end{equation}
where $I=q|\alpha|^2/\tau = 2qB|\alpha|^2$. Since $|\alpha|^2$ corresponds to the number of photons, we can see that the shot-noise limited SNR is equal to the number of photons.

\subsection{Thermal noise}
Thermal noise appears as voltage noise or current noise of a resistor $R$, which is used for converting a photocurrent $I$ to a voltage $RI$ as shown Fig. \ref{fig:photodetector}(a). The RMS voltage of the thermal noise or Johnson noise\index{Johnson noise} is given by
\begin{equation}
	v_\mathrm{th} = \sqrt{4k_\mathrm{B}TRB},
	\label{eq:Johnson_noise}
\end{equation}
where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature of the resistor. It is important to suppress the thermal noise by optimizing the circuit design for achieving the shot-noise-limited SNR. 

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=7cm]{fig/2-2_PD_circuit.eps} 
  \caption{(a) Typical photodetection circuit, where a photodiode is inversely biased. The photocurrent $I$ flows to a load resistor $R$ and measure the voltage $RI$. (b) Two-resistor  circuit, which is used to consider the Johnson noise.}
  \label{fig:photodetector}
\end{figure}

To derive Eq. (\ref{eq:Johnson_noise}), we consider a circuit shown in Fig. \ref{fig:photodetector}, where two resistors ($R_1$, $R_2$) are connected with each other, and they are impedance-matched.\cite{nyquist1928} Since $v_\mathrm{th}$ is the electromotive force in one of the resistors and the series resistance is $2R$, it leads to a current of $v_\mathrm{th}/2R$. Therefore, each resistor generates power of $v_\mathrm{th}^2/2R$ and is in the thermal equilibrium.\footnote{If the resistors have different temperature, their temperatures get closer to each other by transferring energy with thermal current.} Here we consider the voltage noise in the frequency range from $-B = -1/2\tau$ to $B = 1/2\tau$. The sampling theorem tells us that the noise waveform can be captured by sampling it with a period of $\tau$. The noise at each sampling point is independent of each other, and its average energy is Boltzmann energy $k_\mathrm BT$.\footnote{The reason why each degree of freedom has an energy of $k_\mathrm B T$ instead of $k_\mathrm B T/2$ is that each degree of freedom corresponds to a thermally excited harmonic oscillator which has two degree of freedom of position and momentum. In the case of ideal gas, each atom has three momentum axis but not fixed at a point, leading to a kinetic energy of $3k_\mathrm B T / 2$.} Therefore,
\begin{equation}
v_\mathrm{th}^2\tau/2R = v_\mathrm{th}^2 / 4RB = k_\mathrm{B}T,
\end{equation}
which leads to Eq. (\ref{eq:Johnson_noise}).
